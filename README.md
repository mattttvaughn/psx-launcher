# PSx Launcher 

A launcher with a UI like the PlayStation UI. This was just a quick 1-2 day
thing I made so it will probably not run right unless you have a 21:9 phone.

![Demo](demo/demo.webm)

I don't plan to continue working on this, but feel free to fork it and make
your own versions of it.

All of the code I wrote is licensed under the MIT license (anything in java/.../ps5launcher directory
and the layout files in res/layout). Libraries are under their respective licenses.

## To do:

Some useful things which might be worth adding

 - Save installed apps in database for quicker loading
 - Android 11 requires a new permission for queryIntentActivities
 - Better support for different device configurations: PSAppLayoutManager.kt
 - A background which fades in backgrounds from the focused app would be awesome
 - Include a PSX-like wallpaper into the app by default
 - Support icon packs
 - Scroll to top on "home button press"
